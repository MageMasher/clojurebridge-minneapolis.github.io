# Building the docs locally

To build the docs locally follow the steps below.

1. Install python, pip, and virtualenvwrapper
2. Set up a virtualenv for the project with virtualenvwrapper. I chose to call mine "installfest"
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `make html`
5. Open up `_build/index.html` in your favorite editor
